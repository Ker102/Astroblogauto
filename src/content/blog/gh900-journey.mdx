I have a confession to make: **I failed my first attempt at the GitHub Foundations (GH-900) exam.**

Despite having hands-on experience with Git and taking a dedicated DataCamp course, I walked out of that first exam humbled. But looking back, failing was the best thing that could have happened to my development career.

## The First Attempt: A Reality Check

I went in confident. I knew how to commit, push, pull, and manage branches. I thought I was ready.

But the exam threw curveballs I wasn't expecting. It wasn't just about "using Git"; it was about the **entire GitHub ecosystem**.

The questions drilled deep into:
- **GitHub Enterprise**: Management, billing, and organization structures I had never touched as a solo dev.
- **GitHub Actions**: Specific syntax and workflow configurations that went far beyond simple CI scripts.

I realized my knowledge was "practical" but narrow. I knew how to *code*, but I didn't know how to *administer* and *automate* at an enterprise scale.

## The Rabbit Hole: Going Deep

After the failure, I didn't just want to pass; I wanted to master it. I pivoted to the official **Microsoft Learn** documentation and decided to explore *every single feature* GitHub offers.

I built multiple projects solely to test features I'd ignored:
- Configuring complex **Branch Protection Rules**.
- Setting up **Code Owners** to enforce review policies.
- Diving into **GitHub Projects** for agile management.
- Writing intricate **GitHub Actions** workflows.

## The Second Attempt: Mastery

When I sat for the exam the second time, it was a completely different experience. I didn't just know the answers; I understood the *why* behind them. I passed with an excellent score.

However, I still have one critique.

### The Missing Piece: The Command Line
Ironically, the one area where I was strongest—the **Git CLI**—was barely present.

The exam focuses heavily on the *web interface* and *platform features*. It asks about button clicks in settings menus but skips the nitty-gritty of `git rebase -i` or `git cherry-pick`. If you're a command-line warrior, don't expect that to save you here.

## What the Exam Actually Covers

If you're planning to take GH-900, know that "Foundations" is a bit of a misnomer. It covers a lot of ground.

### 1. GitHub Actions (The Big One)
You need to understand CI/CD pipelines inside and out.

It's not enough to know what it is; you need to know how to read a YAML workflow file, understand triggers (`on: push`, `on: pull_request`), and manage secrets.

### 2. GitHub Enterprise & Security
Expect questions on:
- **SAML SSO**: How authentication works in big orgs.
- **Dependabot**: How to configure automated security updates.
- **Secret Scanning**: What happens when you accidentally commit an API key.

## Conclusion

Failing the GH-900 pushed me down a rabbit hole that expanded my skills far beyond just "version control." The extra knowledge I gained—especially in automation and project management—has been invaluable in my recent projects.

If you fail, don't be discouraged. Use it as a roadmap for what you still need to learn. The destination is worth it.
